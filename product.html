    <p> This duo, mobile app and parking meter, tackle pain points with
      the cushion time and the scan-and-go feature. These allow
      drivers to be both flexible and efficient with their time
      while providing a feeling of assurance and less risk of
      getting a ticket. I still wanted to retain the traditional parking meter for those who did not want to use a mobile app. My group and I considered an older population that could potentially be unfamiliar or unwilling with mobile technology.
      <br><br>
      My inspiration for the parking meter itself came from our Amazon Pick-up locations, where shoppers can scan a barcode on their phone and pick up their items in a timely and simple fashion.
