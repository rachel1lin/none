        Along with transcribing the language of the Aleutian islands,
        I helped Edwin, our team's doctorate student mentor, draw up a
        background image for the online corpus we were working on.
        The goal was to keep it culturally correct, and after a several
        ideas of modern Aleutian art and simplified basket patterns, I
        decided to stick to the roots.
        <br><br>
        The very survival of the Aleuts rested on their hunting diet of seals,
        puffins, and whales among other foods. My team and I enjoyed encountering
        these animals during our readings of grammar books and old tales. I hoped
        to tie in the origins of Aleutian history and my team's enthusiasm for the Unangam
        Tunuu language in my web design.

        Given a set of information to include on the sales landing page,
        my job was to create an aesthetic, persuasive web page that would
        close the deal for the start-up's sales.

        My first thought went to analyzing the purpose of the company's product.
        It was an easy-to-use software catered towards helping small businesses
        in managing and optimizing their organization, marketing, and finances, and data analyses.
        I then structured my planning around creating a simple yet informative
        web page, following the philosophy of the software.
